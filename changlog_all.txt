Changelog 0.0.7: Finishing up some work


Alright, this took a while (:S)
First of we had a little glitch and broke CraftTweaker (apparently in every humanly possible way) And now I messed quite a few TE machines up (TE internal names are pure fun)
But we’re getting back on track!
This time I enabled more TE machinery, reworked some conduits and made a little test on Embers and Steel generation (Liquificated coal is good for something, atleast)
The next update will be out once I get up, I’m nowhere near release happy with Mekanism and don’t want to go over that later.
Expect Major Script Updates for Tech AND Magic, cuz looking 24/7 at tech is pretty boring

Oh BTW We’re using ATLauncher now, so give me a DM with your Minecraft Username and I’ll add you to the Tester Team
As a quick FYI:
    We’re using Beyond Reality: Farscapes as a test pack, so once you’re added, you will have to either update your old Instance with the new “Dev-Wildlands-1.12.2” version or create a new one!

Changelog 0.0.6: we’re getting there


First of: A quick apology for my Update cycle, it’s was not that great during the last days, but changing recipes for an hour is already exhausting enough. But I’m still out there and I’m still doing headsho… oh wait wrong theme!
Anyways… Last Big Update for Industry/Tech mods, after that we’re shifting our attention on the magical aspect!
